# The Code Crusader ü¶á - A Batman-Inspired Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, designed with a dark, cinematic, comic-book aesthetic inspired by Batman. This isn't just a resume; it's a showcase of my skills and projects, presented as a hero's journey through the world of technology.

### \#\# About The Project

This project is a fully responsive, single-page personal portfolio built for a Computer Science student. The goal was to create a website that is both thematically engaging and professionally polished, suitable for showcasing skills and projects to recruiters and potential employers. The entire user interface is designed to feel like stepping into a superhero's digital Batcave, with advanced animations and a consistent comic-book style.
